# [Reconnect-Ed Hackathon Website](https://reconnect-ed.github.io/)

This site was made with [vitepress](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/). Yes, this is a docs generator. No, I don't care.

## TODO

- [ ] Add real devpost link
- [ ] Real sponsors
- [ ] Actual team
- [ ] Actual twitch
- [ ] New icon

Content lives in the `site` dir in `.md` files.
It is safe to edit these files (with an exception of `index.md`) even if you don't have coding experience.
